# VGuard: the read policy of a relay

`vguard` stands between nginx and strfry on a relay of the network. Every
WebSocket of the relay goes through it, every frame goes on as it is, but
a question that could read what is not the asker's is answered by vguard
itself and never reaches strfry.

Why: the relay holds the gift wraps of direct messages (kind 1059),
addressed by `#p`, and the events of groups (kind 9), named by `#h`. Their
contents are sealed; who gets wraps, when, and which groups talk is not.
The key that lets a client past nginx is in every copy of the app, so it
keeps nobody out. strfry 1.1.3 has no read policy of its own (its
`filterValidation` knows `authors`, `#p` and `#e`, not `#h`, and nothing
of NIP-42).

```
client ──wss──▶ nginx :443 ──ws──▶ vguard 127.0.0.1:7778 ──ws──▶ strfry 127.0.0.1:7777
                  │ checks the key (app or peer)
                  │ peer key → X-Veydan-Role: peer
                  └─ no Upgrade (NIP-11, the page of strfry) ──▶ strfry
```

## The rules

For REQ and COUNT, each filter; for NEG-OPEN (NIP-77), its one filter. A
question passes only whole: one filter refused refuses it.

| The filter | Passes when |
|---|---|
| `ids`, every one a full event id (64 hex) | always: an id names its event, and nobody guesses one; the push of a message carries one |
| `kinds` names 1059, or no `kinds` | `#p` is not empty and every value in it is the key this connection signed in with (NIP-42) |
| `kinds` names 9, or no `kinds` | `#h` is not empty, no value in it empty |
| any other `kinds` | always (profiles, follow lists, relay lists, presence, the codes of a device link…) |

So a filter without `kinds` must do both, and a filter without `kinds`
and without `#p` and `#h` (`{}`, `{"limit": 100}`, `{"authors": […]}`)
never passes. An empty `kinds` list is read as no `kinds`. A REQ without a
filter does not pass.

What vguard cannot read for certain does not pass at all: `kinds` that are
not whole numbers of 0…65535, a tag list that is not a list of strings,
`ids` that are not full ids, and an object with one key twice anywhere in
the message (parsers settle that differently, and vguard must read what
strfry reads). A message that is no JSON array with its verb first gets a
`NOTICE` and goes nowhere. A binary frame from a client gets a `NOTICE`:
a nostr message is text.

## The answers

| What | Answer | nostr-sdk then |
|---|---|---|
| a REQ or COUNT for wraps of a key, not signed in yet | held until the AUTH (see "Signing in"), then answered; with no AUTH in time `["CLOSED", <id>, "auth-required: …"]` | signs in and asks again |
| the same as NEG-OPEN | held the same way; with no AUTH in time `["NEG-ERR", <id>, "auth-required: …"]` | falls back to a REQ (the app's sync does), which strfry caps at `maxFilterLimit` |
| anything else refused | `CLOSED` / `NEG-ERR` with `restricted: …` or `invalid: …` | gives the subscription up |
| over `max_subs` open subscriptions | `CLOSED` / `NEG-ERR` with `error: too many …` | — |

A refused REQ that would replace an open subscription of the same id
closes the old one at strfry too (`CLOSE`), as strfry would have replaced
it.

## Signing in (NIP-42)

strfry gives a challenge as the connection opens; vguard notes it and
passes it on. The client's `AUTH` is checked by vguard as strfry checks
it: kind 22242, the id and the signature, `created_at` within
`auth_skew_secs` (3 days: the clock of many a phone is off by hours, and a
phone that cannot sign in gets no message at all), a `challenge` tag this
connection was given and has not signed in with yet,
and a `relay` tag that names this relay — `ws` or `wss` and one of
`relay_hosts` (the relay and its aliases); a path or a query (the app key
the app puts there) does not matter. Without that last check a relay
elsewhere could pass our challenge on to its own user and sign in here as
them.

vguard answers the AUTH itself (`OK`), passes it on to strfry as it is,
and drops strfry's own `OK` to it: strfry knows one name of the relay and
compares the whole URL, and the client must know it is signed in before
it asks again. One key per connection, as strfry: a second key is refused.

A challenge signs in once. The same AUTH sent again on the connection,
or another event over the same challenge, is refused (`invalid: not the
challenge of this connection`); the connection stays signed in. So the
wide window of `created_at` opens no replay: an AUTH is good on one
connection (whose challenge is random and its own), for this relay, once.

When a question needs a signed-in key and no challenge has come from
strfry, vguard waits `challenge_wait_ms` (2 s) for one, then gives a
challenge of its own; an AUTH over it stays with vguard.

When a question needs a signed-in key and a challenge is out but the
client has not answered it yet, the question waits for the AUTH, up to
`auth_wait_ms` (5 s). The app asks for its history (NEG-OPEN, then REQ)
as the connection opens, before it has signed in; a refusal sent it to a
plain REQ, which strfry caps at `maxFilterLimit` (500), so a new device
got only the newest 500 wraps. While a question waits, vguard holds
everything else the client sends after it, in order: a later REQ of the
same id, a CLOSE or an EVENT never overtakes it. Only the AUTH goes
ahead. Once the AUTH is answered (taken or refused), the held frames are
answered in the order they came, as if they had come then: signed in,
the question passes; not, it gets `auth-required`. With no AUTH within
`auth_wait_ms`, the same. At most 32 frames or 1 MiB are held; one more
ends the wait at once. A connection waits once: after a wait it ended,
a question is answered at once. `auth_wait_ms = 0`: no wait, the question
is refused at once. A question that waited for strfry's challenge (or got
vguard's own) then waits for the AUTH the same way.

## Peers

nginx names a connection that came with the key of the peers (the router
and the sync of the other relays of the mesh, VPush, `MESH_PEER_KEY`) by
the header `X-Veydan-Role: peer`. nginx sets the header itself: a client's
own never passes (`proxy_set_header` with an empty value drops it).
vguard believes the header only on a connection from this machine. A peer
reads everything; its frames pass untouched.

VPush watches every relay of the network with the key of the peers, by
`#p` of every registered user and `#h` of every group watched: the relay
learns that list (`spec/protocol.md`, "What a push server cannot do").

## Denied keys

The owner of the network can deny a key on every server it runs
(Veydan Cloud, `services/cloud/spec/cloud-api.md` §14), after a report
about it. vcloud lays the denied keys on the relay as a file, one key a
line, 64 lowercase hex, `#` for a comment; vguard reads the file named by
`denied_keys_file` (the kit: `/opt/vguard/data/denied-keys.txt`, written
by the root helper of the agent with the group of the folder), and reads
it again when its mtime changes, at most once a minute. No line in the
config, no file, or an empty file: nobody is denied, and vguard works as
before. A file that does not read never replaces the list read before;
the journal says so.

For a client connection (a peer reads and writes everything, as above):

| What | Answer |
|---|---|
| `AUTH` signed by a denied key | `["OK", <id>, false, "restricted: key denied"]`; the connection is not signed in, so it reads no gift wrap of that key |
| `EVENT` whose `pubkey` is denied (a profile, a follow list, a media authorization of kind 24242, an event of a group…) | `["OK", <id>, false, "blocked: key denied"]`; strfry never gets it |
| `EVENT` vguard cannot read for certain, while somebody is denied | a `NOTICE`, as any message it cannot read |
| `REQ`/`COUNT` whose every filter names `authors` and every author is denied (after the rules above) | answered here as empty: `EOSE` or `["COUNT", <id>, {"count": 0}]`; a REQ that replaced an open one of the same id ends that one at strfry |
| an `EVENT` of a denied key strfry sends back to any other question | dropped on its way to the client |

What it cannot do. A gift wrap (kind 1059) is signed by a key made for
it, so a wrap from a denied key cannot be told from another: a denied key
can still send direct messages, and that is for the apps and the manifest
of the network to refuse. A `COUNT` that names other authors too counts
the denied key's events. Events a denied key stored before the denial
stay in strfry; through vguard nobody gets them.

The counters `denied_auth`, `denied_events`, `denied_answered` and
`denied_dropped` go to the journal with the others.

## Denied groups

The owner can close a whole group on the relays of the network, after a
report on the group (`services/cloud/spec/cloud-api.md` §14.7). vcloud lays
the closed groups beside the denied keys, as a file of their own: one id
of a group a line (the `h` of its events, as the app writes it: 64
lowercase hex for ours; any 1 to 128 printable ASCII characters without a
space are taken), `#` for a comment. vguard reads the file named by
`denied_groups_file` (the kit: `/opt/vguard/data/denied-groups.txt`) and
reads it again as it does the keys: when its mtime changes, at most once
a minute; a file that does not read keeps the list before. No line in the
config, no file, or an empty file: no group is closed. An id is compared
as it is, not folded to lower case.

For a client connection (a peer reads and writes everything):

| What | Answer |
|---|---|
| `REQ`/`COUNT` whose every filter names in `#h` closed groups alone (after the rules above) | answered here as empty: `EOSE` or `["COUNT", <id>, {"count": 0}]`; a REQ that replaced an open one of the same id ends that one at strfry |
| `REQ`/`COUNT` whose `#h` names closed groups among open ones | goes on to strfry **without** the closed ids, and without a filter whose every `#h` was closed; a question that names no closed group goes on byte for byte |
| `NEG-OPEN` whose `#h` names closed groups alone | `["NEG-ERR", <id>, "restricted: group denied"]` |
| `NEG-OPEN` whose `#h` names closed groups among open ones | goes on without the closed ids |
| `EVENT` with an `h` tag of a closed group, whoever signed it (any `h`, not the first alone) | `["OK", <id>, false, "blocked: group denied"]`; strfry never gets it |
| an `EVENT` with an `h` of a closed group strfry sends back to any question (one by `ids`, a sync) | dropped on its way to the client |

Why the ids are taken out rather than the question refused: the app asks
for the events of all its groups in one filter, and one closed group must
not cut a member off from the others. `#h` is a condition every event a
filter matches meets, so a filter whose every `#h` is closed can match the
events of closed groups alone, and nothing is lost by leaving it out; a
`COUNT` without them counts the open groups only.

What it cannot do. The events of a closed group stay in strfry; through
vguard nobody gets them. A group is no key: its members can still sign
in, write in other groups and to each other; their keys are denied apart
("Denied keys"). A relay without vguard, or another relay, still carries
the group: for that the apps read `banned_groups` of the signed manifest
of the network.

The counters `groups_answered` (questions answered as empty or a sync
refused), `groups_filtered` (questions sent on without the closed ids),
`groups_events` and `groups_dropped` go to the journal with the others;
no id is logged.

## Limits

| `[limits]` | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `max_frame` | 262144 | the largest frame from a client; strfry's `maxWebsocketPayloadSize`; over it the connection ends (close 1009) |
| `max_subs` | 200 | open REQ (and, apart, NEG-OPEN) per connection; strfry's `maxSubsPerConnection` |
| `max_filters` | 200 | filters in one REQ or COUNT; strfry's `maxReqFilterSize` |
| `max_connections` | 20000 | connections at once; more are closed at once |
| `handshake_secs` | 10 | the WebSocket handshake of nginx |
| `connect_secs` | 5 | the connection to strfry; without it the client's closes (1011) |
| `idle_secs` | 300 | no frame either way; nginx's `proxy_read_timeout`. strfry's ping every 55 s goes on to the client, so a live client never gets there |
| `auth_skew_secs` | 259200 | how far `created_at` of an AUTH may be from now (3 days) |
| `challenge_wait_ms` | 2000 | see "Signing in" |
| `auth_wait_ms` | 5000 | how long a question before the AUTH waits for it; 0: not at all. See "Signing in" |

`[log] metrics_secs` (300 by default) writes the counters to the journal:
connections, peers, questions passed, refused and why, AUTH taken and
refused, own challenges, waits for the AUTH ended by it, by the time
(`auth_wait_expired`) and by too much held (`auth_wait_overflow`), frames
too large, idle ends, strfry not reached.
No address and no key is logged. strfry still gets the client's address
as `X-Real-IP`.

## Running it

```
vguard serve --config /opt/vguard/etc/vguard.toml
vguard check-config --config …      every problem of the file at once
vguard probe --config …             REQ kinds 0 limit 0 through vguard to strfry, until EOSE
vguard --version
```

On a server of the kit it is part of the relay (`services/server`,
`components/guard.sh`): installed from `bin/vguard` of the kit (made by
`make build-deploy`) or the release of Veydan-Push named by
`VGUARD_VERSION` (`vguard-linux-<arch>`, signed by the release key as
the component `vguard`; every release since 0.4.0 carries it beside
`vpush`); started after strfry; nginx is turned to it only once `vguard
probe` answers. Without a vguard the kit puts up no relay: it stops
before it changes anything and names `VGUARD_VERSION`.
